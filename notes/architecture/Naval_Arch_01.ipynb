    "- displacement: $\\Delta = \\rho g V$ where $\\rho$ is water density, $g$ is gravity and $V$ is the (designed) underwater volume (\"displacement volume\"). The end unit is Newtons\n",

    "\n",
    "Bouyancy forces act vertically and horizontally to counteract gravity. Horizontal components cancel out in the static case. The gravitational force is considered to act at the center of mass. The buoyant forces act at the center of buoyancy. These can be determined by the computer with some handy integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stability at small angles\n",
    "\n",
    "The ship's body is rolled. Center of mass doesn't change relative to the solid body (in the rigid body case). The underwater shape changes, shifting the center of buoyancy. The \"metacenter\" is where the new line of buoyant force action intersects the original line of action. This is generally above the center of gravity or the hull design is unstable. The righting lever arm that keeps the ship stable is measured as the weight of the ship cross the horizontal distance between the center of mass and the center of buoyancy. Conceptually, the weight of the boat rolls around its center of bouyancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "These calculations can be calculated in closed form for simple geometries. I like my integrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could also be applied pitching the design fore and aft. Ships tend to be longer than they are wide, so they tend to be stable longitudinally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization**: Conventionally, these calculations are done for many waterplanes/loading weights around the designed on to show stability in a variety of conditions. These are drawn in a continuing range to show stability curves based on loading (e.g. one could draw a lever arm calculation calculated for different degrees of roll and load).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization**: The longitudinal and transverse center of gravity against the profile and amidships planes.\n",

    "**Future Reading**: Stability. A more detailed discussion on stability, with both worked and set examples, is to be found in Derrett and Barrass (1999)."
